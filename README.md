## rewise-basics
This repo is a collection of CS, Data Structures and Algorithms basics. Don't consider this repo as a cleanest code ever source, but more like an Objective-C playground. 

PS. If you want a real Objective-C Playground check an amazing [project](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/KZPlayground).
